[BUGS] (BUILD 2020.9.11 HEAD 82d25db7669d2c07c12f535fef994cf4a33a0789):
	-Console not working (throwing NullReferenceExceptions on each keypress)
	-No 16:10 resolutions
	-Fullscreen and windowed modes are inverted
	-Game paused screen showing up after every settings menu, even in main menu
	-Sometimes jumps don't register
	-Needs to be a binding options, at least for the scroll wheel to jump. Jumping with spacebar feels so old
	-It looks like that the momentum translation doesn't change based on where the player is looking!!!!! THIS IS VERY BAD!!!!
