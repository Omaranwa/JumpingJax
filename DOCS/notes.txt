[BUGS] (BUILD 2020.9.11 HEAD 82d25db7669d2c07c12f535fef994cf4a33a0789):
	-Console not working (throwing NullReferenceExceptions on each keypress)
	-No 16:10 resolutions
	-Fullscreen and windowed modes are inverted
	-Game paused screen showing up after every settings menu, even in main menu
	-Sometimes jumps don't register
	-Needs to be a binding options, at least for the scroll wheel to jump. Jumping with spacebar feels so old
	//It looks like that the momentum translation doesn't change based on where the player is looking!!!!! THIS IS VERY BAD!!!!
	-Ledge detection needs to be reworked. Both for jumping and landing. The player can't slide up the corner of a block.
	-Sometimes jumps register twice, causing me to go flying in the air after landing
	- VERY BAD::: PHYSICS ARE MORE CONSISTENT IN THE EDITOR!!!!!!!!! ---ATTENTION-----
	-It looks like that in certain cases the forward momentum carries over to the backward one when switching directions rapidly

[NOTES] 2020.09.15

"""""but another good rule of thumb is to always make your map as if everybody playing is an idiot. if it's a difficult map, 
everybody playing is good at bhop but an idiot in general. a good example of why i say this is in kz maps, 
we always need to show what blocks are bhop blocks and what aren't. because there will always be that one guy who dm's you saying 
your map's impossible. and we usually do this by like outlining the block or putting particles above it or something like that"""""

- OUTLINE WHAT BHOP BLOCKS AND WHAT ISN'T.
- USING POINT LIGHTING INSTEAD OF AMBIENT LIGHTING ADDS TO REALISM.
- AT THE BEGGINING, THE MAPS NEED TO BE SIMPLE, BECAUSE THE PLAYER WILL NEED TO FLICK THE CAMERA TO GAIN SPEED.
- GAME SHOULD START AT DAYLIGHT TO GIVE THE PLAYER A FEELING OF ADVENTURE.
- FOG COLOR CAN CHANGE FOR CRAZY LEVELS, FOG CAN DISABLE FOR EASY ONES.
