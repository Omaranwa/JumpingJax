[BUGS] (BUILD 2020.9.11 HEAD 82d25db7669d2c07c12f535fef994cf4a33a0789):
	-Console not working (throwing NullReferenceExceptions on each keypress)
	-No 16:10 resolutions
	-Fullscreen and windowed modes are inverted
	-Game paused screen showing up after every settings menu, even in main menu
	-Sometimes jumps don't register
	-Needs to be a binding options, at least for the scroll wheel to jump. Jumping with spacebar feels so old
	//It looks like that the momentum translation doesn't change based on where the player is looking!!!!! THIS IS VERY BAD!!!!
	-Ledge detection needs to be reworked. Both for jumping and landing. The player can't slide up the corner of a block.
	-Sometimes jumps register twice, causing me to go flying in the air after landing
	- VERY BAD::: PHYSICS ARE MORE CONSISTENT IN THE EDITOR!!!!!!!!! ---ATTENTION-----
	-It looks like that in certain cases the fowrward momentum carries over to the backward one when switching directions rapidly
